# finetuned_PaliGemma_with_JAX_keshav_kumar_04
## Excited to announce the fine-tuning of my solo project - Google's Paligemma, a lightweight open vision-language model (VLM) inspired by PaLI-3! ðŸŽ‰

## Based on open components like the SigLIP vision model and the Gemma language model, Paligemma takes both images and text as inputs, allowing it to perform deeper analysis and provide ##insightful responses. With capabilities ranging from image captioning to object detection and text extraction from images, Paligemma promises to revolutionize the way we interact with ##visual content.

## Stay tuned as this solo endeavor continues to push the boundaries of vision-language models!
